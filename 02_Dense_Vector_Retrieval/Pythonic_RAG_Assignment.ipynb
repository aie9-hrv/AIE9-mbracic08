    "2. OpenAI achieves this by training embedding models to support Matryoshka-style representation learning (as described in the MRL paper).\n",
    "MRL produces nested embeddings, where the first n dimensions capture the core semantic meaning and additional dimensions add finer detail. Since the model is optimized to work well across multiple prefix lengths (e.g., 256, 512, 1024), truncated vectors remain meaningful.\n",

    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",

If we keep the prompt and all parameters the same, we'll usually get the same result, but it’s still “best effort” and can change if OpenAI updates the backend (which can track via system_fingerprint)."

      "Hello! The best way to write a loop in Python depends on what you're trying to accomplish. Here are some common and idiomatic ways to write loops:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **For loop over a sequence:**\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're iterating over a list, tuple, string, or any iterable, the `for` loop is usually the cleanest and most readable:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']\n",
      "for fruit in fruits:\n",
      "    print(fruit)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **For loop with a range:**\n",
      "\n",
      "When you need to repeat something a specific number of times or want to iterate over indices, use `range()`:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "for i in range(5):\n",
      "    print(i)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **While loop:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Use a `while` loop when the number of iterations is not known in advance and depends on some condition:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "count = 0\n",
      "while count < 5:\n",
      "    print(count)\n",
      "    count += 1\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Using list comprehensions (for creating lists):**\n",
      "\n",
      "When you want to create a new list by applying an expression to each item in an iterable, list comprehensions are concise and efficient:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Using `enumerate()` for indices and items together:**\n",
      "\n",
      "When you need both the item and its index:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):\n",
      "    print(index, fruit)\n",

    "Suggestions are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **PDF Support**: Allow it to ingest wellness PDFs (meal plans, workout guides, medical information sheets)\n",
    "- **New Distance Metric**: Implement a different similarity measure - does it improve retrieval for health queries?\n",
    "- **Metadata Support**: Add metadata like topic categories (exercise, nutrition, sleep) or difficulty levels to help filter results\n",
    "- **Different Embedding Model**: Try a different embedding model - does domain-specific tuning help for health content?\n",
    "- **Multi-Source Ingestion**: Add the capability to ingest content from YouTube health videos, podcasts, or health blogs\n",
